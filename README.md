Over the past 5 years, the NYC residential real estate market has experienced significant fluctuations. 📉📈

Currently, the most active neighborhood in NYC is the Upper West Side, with a remarkable 4,910 signed contracts from January 1, 2020, to August 31, 2024. The Upper West Side also boasts the shortest average days on the market at just 100 days. Key neighborhoods like Lenox Hill and Chelsea have contributed to this high activity, presenting excellent opportunities for new builds and developers. 🏡

From 2020 to the present, one-bedroom units have been in the highest demand, with March consistently emerging as the peak month for activity each year. 📌

In contrast, other Manhattan areas like West Harlem, Fort George, and Little Italy have seen lower contract activity, with West Harlem recording the longest average days on the market. This trend may present a chance for savvy investors to secure favorable deals. 🔑
